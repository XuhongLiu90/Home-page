    <h1>Reflection on 'Handmade Web' by J.R. Carpenter</h1>

    <p>
        The idea of the 'handmade web,' as described by J.R. Carpenter, brings to mind a time of personal connection and creative freedom on the internet. It reminds us of when the web was a more intimate space, reflecting the unique creativity of its users. Carpenter draws a sharp distinction between the early, DIY-driven web and today's internet, which is heavily influenced by corporate interests.

        What stands out to me is that the 'handmade web' isn't just a thing of the past; it's a form of resistance. In a digital world where web pages are mostly generated by complex tools and algorithms, Carpenter’s support for hand-coding web pages feels like a push to regain control and authenticity in how we express ourselves online. This message is particularly relevant now, as our online identities are often shaped by the limitations of corporate platforms.

    <blockquote>
        As Carpenter puts it, "The more proprietary, predatory, and puerile a place the web becomes, the more committed I am to using it in poetic and intransigent ways." This quote underscores the diminishing connection with the web's foundational code, especially as mobile devices take over how we browse. This isn‘t just a technical loss, but also a cultural and creative one, as fewer people have the chance to interact with the web as a flexible medium that they can truly make their own.

        Carpenter’s essay serves as a powerful reminder of the web’s potential as a space for personal expression. It encourages us to think about how we can bring some of the 'handmade web' spirit into our current digital practices. Whether by coding a simple page by hand, participating in creative web projects, or simply appreciating the craft of a well-designed site, there's value in revisiting the principles of the early web.

        In a world that values efficiency and scale, the 'handmade web' offers an alternative—a chance to slow down, to create with intention, and to remember that the web, at its best, is a platform for genuine personal expression and connection.
