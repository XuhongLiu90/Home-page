    <h1>Reflection on 'Handmade Web' by J.R. Carpenter</h1>

    <p>
        The concept of the 'handmade web,' as articulated by J.R. Carpenter, evokes a sense of nostalgia and resistance. It takes us back to a time when the internet was more personal, intimate, and a true reflection of individual creativity. Carpenter's narrative draws a poignant contrast between the early web, characterized by its amateur aesthetics and DIY ethos, and the current corporate-dominated internet landscape.

        What strikes me most is the notion that the handmade web is more than just a relic of the past; it is an act of defiance. In an age where web pages are predominantly generated by sophisticated tools and algorithms, Carpenter's advocacy for hand-coding web pages resonates as a call to reclaim a sense of agency and authenticity in our digital expressions. This is particularly relevant in today's world, where our online identities are often shaped and constrained by corporate platforms.

    <blockquote>
        "The more proprietary, predatory, and puerile a place the web becomes, the more committed I am to using it in poetic and intransigent ways."
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        Carpenter's reflection also highlights the loss of direct interaction with the web's underlying code, particularly as mobile devices and tablets increasingly dominate our browsing experiences. This loss is not just a technical one but also a cultural and creative diminution, as fewer people have the opportunity to engage with the web as a malleable medium that they can shape and personalize.

        Ultimately, this essay is a reminder of the power and potential of the web as a platform for individual expression. It encourages us to consider how we might bring some of the ethos of the 'handmade web' into our modern digital practices. Whether through hand-coding a simple page, engaging with creative web projects, or simply taking the time to appreciate the artistry of a well-crafted site, there is much to be gained from revisiting the values of the early web.

        In a world increasingly driven by efficiency and scale, the 'handmade web' serves as a counterpointâ€”an invitation to slow down, to create with care, and to remember that the web, at its best, is a space for personal expression and connection.
